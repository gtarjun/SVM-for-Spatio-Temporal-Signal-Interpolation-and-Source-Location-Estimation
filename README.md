# SVM-for-Spatio-Temporal-Signal-Interpolation-and-Source-Location-Estimation
Support Vector Machines are known to have superior generalization capabilities owing to their treatment of outliers. However, they are almost always used in scenarios where supervised learning can be readily applied due to the presence of target values. In this research we proposed an unsupervised SVM approach to interpolation of spatio-temporal signals using squared exponential kernels and linear SVM. We introduced the interpolation approach to solve the AOA estimation problem with unevenly distributed sensors by estimating the interpolated signal and further processing it with  root-MuSiC. The two step approach involving the high generalization capabilities of SVM and the highest resolution of root-MuSiC was shown to achieve near optimal performance in a multi sensor multi signal scenario in the presence of noise.
